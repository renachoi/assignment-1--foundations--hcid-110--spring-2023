    <p>Felicia Chiao is an American artist who works as an industrial designer by day and an illustrator by night.  Traveling a lot, she always has a notebook in her hand on which she does most of her work. All her work is traditionally done with Copic markers on brown paper, giving her creations an absolutely unique touch.

    What is striking when you discover her work is undoubtedly this style and color palette. One is all soothed up in a dreamlike, calm world from which a certain nostalgia is transparent. One is often in front of a small character, seeming to wander as well as waiting in his house. Numerous touches of surrealism are added, giving us the impression that the artist depicts his own dreams with brio.
